## The Carpentries Termed Suspension Checklist

When a Code of Conduct (CoC) violation is found, one course of action is that activities in Carpentries channels (in-person and virtual) are monitored. In other cases, the community member is asked to take a termed suspension. When this is the resolution of the CoC committee, the following boundaries are enforced. The checklist below was created for incidents that require an immediate response, i.e. the community member is removed from all Carpentries engagement.

The intended outcomes for such a suspension are immediate, ongoing, and demonstrable changes in any areas of engagement for which the CoC deemed undesirable in the incident review.

- [ ] Teach Instructor Training or lead teaching demonstration sessions. The Deputy Director of Instructor Training (DDIT) will check the teaching demo Etherpad to ensure that the suspended member is not signed up to lead teaching demonstrations and will find a replacement Trainer as needed.

### Trainer Training
The suspended member will not be allowed to participate in Trainer Training (if they are currently enrolled) and will not be accepted for Trainer Training (if they apply during the suspension period). Additionally, they will not be allowed to shadow a current Carpentries Trainer. They may apply or reapply for future rounds of Trainer Training. 

### Member Organisation and Local Activities
The suspended member shall not be involved in officially branded Carpentries workshops or activities at the member or local site for the duration of the suspension. We expect the suspended member to assert that they will be able to carry out this suspension accordingly and to notify the CoC committee if this suspension will interfere with their expected employment duties. 

If the suspension does affect employment duties or the suspended member is the key contact for a member site, the member will work with The Carpentries Executive Director to determine a course of action.

### Lesson Development and Maintenance
The suspended member will not be allowed to post PRs, issues, or comments to any repository in the carpentries, including but not limited to datacarpentry, swcarpentry, library carpentry, data-lessons, and carpentrieslab organizations. Administrative or write privileges to repositories in these organizations will be removed for the duration of the suspension.

If the suspended member is a Maintainer, their name will be removed from the lessons page and they will not appear on the Maintainers page for the duration of their suspension. 

### Executive Council
If the suspended member is a member of the Executive Council, they will not participate in Executive Council responsibilities and will be removed from the Executive Council repositories and list of Executive Council members on the website for the duration of their suspension. The Executive Council will review the CoC incident to determine if a suspension will affect their long term position on the Executive Council.

### Committees, Task Forces, and Other Interactions
Involvement in all committees, communities, and task forces (African Task Force, Carpentries en LatinoAmérica, etc.) will be suspended. 

- [ ] The suspended members ability to sign in to AMY to manage their own profile or other tasks will be revoked for the duration of their suspension.
